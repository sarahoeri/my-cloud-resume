# Cloud Resume Challenge 
This challenge aims to host a Static Website, which is your Cloud Resume, on AWS using Amazon S3, AWS CloudFront, AWS Certificate Manager, and Amazon Route 53. An Amazon S3 bucket will host the static website. Amazon Route53 will route traffic to the website domain name through a CloudFront distribution. The AWS Certificate Manager will deploy an SSL/TLS certificate for the website so that we can access it securely through HTTPS. 

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Write HTML and CSS for your resume using your favourite IDE
In my case, I used a template from CloudmyTribe Community. You can write your own HTML and CSS code to customize your resume to your liking. I used Gitpod, a Cloud Development Environment with the Visual Studio Code IDE, where I edited the template to add my resume details. Gitpod can be integrated with Github through the Gitpod extension for your browser. This enables you to commit and push your code to your GitHub repository.
