# Cloud Resume - Hosting a Static Website on AWS using Amazon S3, AWS CloudFront, AWS Certificate Manager and Amazon Route 53

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Write HTML and CSS for your resume using your favourite IDE
I used a template from CloudmyTribe in my case, you can write your own HTML and CSS code to customize your resume to your liking. I used Gitpod, a Cloud Development Environment with the Visual Studio Code IDE, where I edited the template to add my resume details. Gitpod can be integrated with Github through the Gitpod extension for your browser. This enables you to commit and push your code to your GitHub repository
